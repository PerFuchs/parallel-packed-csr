# Parallel Packed CSR
A parallel implementation of the packed CSR data structure, based on its initial single threaded design[[1]](#1)(https://github.com/wheatman/Packed-Compressed-Sparse-Row/).
Accepts a core graph, which it loads first and an update file, which it uses to update the core graph (insert or delete edges).
Uses a thread pool to perform updates in parallel.

# Prerequisites
* CMAKE 3.5 or newer required.

# Build
The commands to build are the following:

```
$ cd src
$ cmake .
$ make
```

# Data files
The data files included in the `data/` directory are the following:

* `shuffled_higgs.txt`: core graph, a shuffled version of the [Higgs Twitter dataset](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/higgs-twitter.html).
* `update_files/insertions.txt`: a list of 1 million edges, randomly sampled from a power law distribution, to be inserted.
* `update_files/deletions.txt`: a list of 1 million edges in the core graph to be deleted.

`shuffled_higgs.txt` was uploaded using `git lfs`. Steps to retrieve it:

```
 curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
 apt install git-lfs
 cd <repo>
 git lfs install
 git lfs pull
```

# Running
Run with `./pcsr2`

## Command line options
* `-threads=`: specifies number of threads to use for updates, default=8
* `-size=`: specifies number of edges that will be read from the update file, default=1000000
* `-lock_free`: runs the data structure lock-free version of binary search, locks during binary search by default
* `-insert`: inserts the edges from the update file to the core graph
* `-delete`: deletes the edges from the update file from the core graph
* `-core_graph=`: specifies the filename of the core graph, default=shuffled_higgs.txt
* `-update_file=`: specifies the filename of the update file, default=insertions.txt
